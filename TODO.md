# canvon/gtkmm\_test - TODO list

## ls-gui-cvn

  * Complete the symlink support:

    * Read symlink target and add it to the name column.

  * Implement uid/gid -> user/group lookup.

  * Use fixed-width font for at least the mode string column.

  * Right-align more numbers: uid/gid

  * Filter out dot-files/dot-dirs, with option to turn that off again.
