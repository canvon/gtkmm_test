## ls-gui-cvn

  * Complete the symlink support -- but what would still need to get implemented?

  * Implement date/time processing & display.

  * Implement uid/gid -> user/group lookup.

  * Right-align more numbers: uid/gid

  * Filter out dot-files/dot-dirs, with option to turn that off again.

  * Replace ListStore by TreeStore and allow manual descend into child directories.

  * Allow sorting.

  * Have auto-completion in the location entry.

  * Add Label before the location entry.
