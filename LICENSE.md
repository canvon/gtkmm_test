# canvon/gtkmm\_test licensing

This source code compilation contains the following parts.


From the book "Programming with gtkmm 3"; these are under GNU GPL-2
as explained in README.md, section "Origin". For the license text,
see LICENSE-GPL2, which was downloaded [from gnu.org][GPL-2] on 2017-05-08.
It differs only in white-space from the file COPYING.examples
[from the gtkmm-documentation repository][GPL-2-gtkmm-documentation],
so the canonical GPL-2 text version was included here.

[GPL-2]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
[GPL-2-gtkmm-documentation]:
  https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtkmm-documentation/tree/COPYING.examples?h=gtkmm-3-22
